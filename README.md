# Walmart-Sales-Dashboard

I created yet another interactive dashboard and this time harnessing the power of #Tableau! 📊✨

As a data enthusiast, I’ve always wanted to transforming complex information into clear, actionable insights, and Tableau has been an incredible tool to bring my data stories to life. 📈💡

I want to extend a special shoutout to Jobaaj.com for conducting this two day workshop and Rakshit Vig - Trainer for your awesome training it have been instrumental in helping me overcome challenges and sharpen my Tableau skills. 🤝🙌

As a part of day one workshop I created my first ever Tableau dashboard ✨
The dashboard depicts 4 charts of a hypothetical raw data from Walmart.
1) Profit by state as a map visualisation
2) Profit by customers name as a bar chart with conditional colour formatting
3) Sales by category
4) Sales and profit by time – which is a dual chart

Creating this dashboard was an exhilarating experience that pushed me to expand my technical skills, exercise my creativity, and refine my data storytelling abilities.
